In order to issue a replacement phone, we will first need you to contact Verizon directly to determine if your phone is under warranty and if the issue can be resolved without replacing.
Verizon's contact number is 800.922.0204.

If the phone is under warranty, Verizon will issue a replacement directly. If the phone is not under warranty and the issue cannot be resolved, please let us know and we will escalate for replacement.
